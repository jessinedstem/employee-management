# Review Comments

* request and response can be two packages in contract.
* @Email annotation can be used in EmployeeRequest for email
* Annotations like @RequiredArgsConstructor can be used in EmployeeService and EmployeeController instead of the code snippets in service and controller .
* There is no exception thrown for employee not found in getEmployeesByDepartment in EmployeeService.
* There are commented lines of code in EmployeeServiceTest.
